# ConnexionMonitor

## Quick start
To use the script, open a PowerShell prompt and call the python executable then the script path.
This script will generate a log containing all the runtime infromation and a CSV output with all the measurements.

## ToDo
* What happens if the connexion drops during an up/download test?
