# ConnexionMonitor

## Quick start
To use the script, open a PowerShell prompt and call the python executable then the script path.
This script will generate a log containing all the runtime infromation and a CSV output with all the measurements.

## ToDo
* [ ] What happens if the connexion drops during an up/download test?
* [ ] To avoid clogging the connection, ping should be measured every minute and up/download every 5 or 10?
* [ ] Test added index & how it integrates with PBI
